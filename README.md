## Overview

Tasked to build an interactive map that displays global earthquakes over the past 7 days and show the relationship to the tectonic plates. You can switch the base layer of the map between 3 choices and activate/deactivate multiple layers that include earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes.

## Results

### Deliverable 1 - Add Tectonic Plate Data
Added tectonic plate data using d3.json(), added the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

### Deliverable 2 - Add Major Earthquake Data
Added major earthquake data to the map using d3.json() and added a color aling with setting the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake. Also added a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

### Deliverable 3 - Add an Additional Map
Added a third mapstyle to the earthquake map.
